# Airline Reservation System
 A simple console menu based flight reservation system
 
 This is a very simple system that has no login feature - meaning the user is not required to login to book a flight. This assumes all flights fly out of Seattle. There are 7 different routes that a user can pick from. The user can book a ticket, reserve a seat, view flight details, ticket details & passenger information. For flight booking, the system asks for the passengerâ€™s information such as name, contact details, gender, and email id. It also takes the user through a mini payment process, where the user has to select whether to pay by Debit, Credit or bank account. once the user has booked a ticket, they can use the ticket number to view ticket details and passenger information and also to reserve a seat. They can also cancel their ticket if they change their mind.
 
 This system was developed using C++ Programming Language
